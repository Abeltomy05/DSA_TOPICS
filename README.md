DSA Challenges Repository

Overview

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges, organized by weeks and topics. It includes implementations of fundamental DSA concepts in JavaScript, such as linked lists, recursion, sorting, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, tries, graphs, and hash tables.

Week-wise Breakdown

Week 1: Introduction to Data Structures & Recursion

Linked Lists (Single & Double)

Searching Algorithms (Binary, Linear, Recursive Search)

Recursion Challenges (Factorial, Fibonacci, Reverse String, Palindrome, etc.)

Week 2: Sorting, Stacks, Queues & Hash Tables

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)

Stack Implementations (Using arrays, linked lists, and solving problems like reverse word, valid parentheses, sorting stacks)

Queue Implementations (Circular Queue, Queue-to-Stack, Stack-to-Queue, etc.)

Hash Table Implementations (Collision handling, Frequency counting, Linear Probing)

Week 3: Trees, Heaps, Tries & Graphs

Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (Insertion, Deletion, Traversals)

Heaps (MaxHeap, MinHeap)

Trie Data Structure

Graph Implementations (Adjacency List, Matrix Representation, BFS & DFS algorithms)
